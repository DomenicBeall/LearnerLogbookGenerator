I thought I'd bang together this website from an idea I had a while ago as a way to learn a little bit about web development. I might come back to it some time when I've learnt more to clean it up, add input validation and the like.

For now I bought a cheap domain, it can be reached at learnerlogbookgenerator.com.

If anybody happens to stumble across this project, DO NOT use it to falsify driving hours if you're still on a paper logbook. Driving is dangerous and you will hurt yourself or others.
