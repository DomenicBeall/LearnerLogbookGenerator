I thought I'd bang together this website from an idea I had a while ago as a way to learn a little bit about web development. I might come back to it some time when I've learnt more to clean it up, add input validation and the like.

If anybody happens to stumble across this project, DO NOT use it to falsify driving hours if you're still on a paper logbook, you genuinely risk life ruining consequences.
